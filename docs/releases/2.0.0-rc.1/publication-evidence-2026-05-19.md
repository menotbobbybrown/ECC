# ECC v2.0.0-rc.1 Publication Evidence - 2026-05-19

This is release-readiness evidence only. It does not create a GitHub release,
npm publication, plugin tag, marketplace submission, billing announcement, or
social announcement.

## Source Commit

| Field | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Upstream main | `c7d662c3c68719e5ef0b5305ca3f6782b3214224` |
| Git remote | `https://github.com/affaan-m/ECC.git` |
| Evidence scope | Current `main` after PR #1990 harness-audit GitHub integration scoring, PR #1991 canonical ECC identity gate, PR #1992 release video-suite gate, PR #1993 growth outreach pack, PR #1994 May 19 publication evidence refresh, PR #1995 operator dashboard refresh, PR #1996 primary render self-eval gate, PR #1997 publish-candidate gate, PR #1998 visual QA gate, PR #1999 video dashboard evidence refresh, PR #2000 suite-count evidence refresh, PR #2001 owner approval packet addition, and PR #2002 owner approval dashboard gate refresh |
| Local status caveat | `git status --short --branch` was clean after pulling `origin/main`; generated evidence files are committed after the source snapshot they describe |

The release operator must repeat all publish-facing checks from the exact final
release commit with a strictly clean checkout before publishing.

## Product And Positioning Evidence

| Surface | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Canonical repo identity | Public URLs and release docs now use `https://github.com/affaan-m/ECC` where public links are needed |
| Release claim | Release notes and launch collateral frame ECC as the harness-native operator system for agentic work, not a Claude-only config pack |
| Video proof | `video-suite-production.md` gates the local rough render, timeline, captions, source inventory, publish-candidate clip set, self-eval, black-frame QA, and no-private-path publication rules |
| Growth proof | `partner-sponsor-talks-pack.md` provides approval-gated copy for sponsors, partners, consulting, talks, podcasts, GitHub Discussion, and video CTAs |
| Owner approval proof | `owner-approval-packet-2026-05-19.md` centralizes release, package, plugin, video, billing, social, and outbound decision gates |
| Business baseline | Hypergrowth command center and partner pack use `$1,728/mo` current MRR, `$10,000/mo` target MRR, and `$8,272/mo` gap |
| Operator dashboard | `operator-readiness-dashboard-2026-05-19.md` pulls the growth baseline into the same queue, publication, video, outbound, AgentShield, ECC Tools, Linear, and supply-chain control surface |
| Linear progress proof | Linear project document `ecc-may-19-post-pr-2002-sync-64cef8f668e0` mirrors the post-PR #2002 state and records active lanes for launch materials, AgentShield, ECC Tools deep analysis, observability, and final release publication |

## Current Publication Blockers

- GitHub prerelease `v2.0.0-rc.1` is still not created in this pass.
- npm `ecc-universal@2.0.0-rc.1` is still not published to the `next`
  dist-tag.
- Claude plugin tag and marketplace propagation remain approval-gated.
- Codex repo-marketplace distribution is verified by prior evidence, but
  official Plugin Directory publishing remains blocked on OpenAI submission or
  listing evidence.
- ECC Tools billing/native-payments copy remains blocked until a Marketplace
  Pro purchase/webhook path writes ready production billing state for a target
  Marketplace test account and the billing announcement gate passes.
- Release notes, X, LinkedIn, GitHub release, GitHub Discussion, longform copy,
  sponsor outreach, partner outreach, consulting copy, conference pitches, and
  podcast pitches still need final live URLs plus human approval before posting
  or sending.
- Discord/community links still need a real invite or bot/guild credential path
  before public docs should route users there.

## Result

The tracked public PR queue, issue queue, discussion queue, canonical ECC
identity, release video suite, preview pack, and growth outreach packet are
current on May 19, 2026 for `main` through
`c7d662c3c68719e5ef0b5305ca3f6782b3214224`. The remaining video work is
owner approval, upload, and public URL attachment, not render or QA production.

This improves publication readiness but does not replace the approval-gated
release, package, plugin, billing, Discord, and announcement steps in
`publication-readiness.md`.
